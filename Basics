Created multiple tabs to app
++++++++++++++++++++
//Go to the Main.Storyboard and add a "View Controller" through the "View the Object Library" list on the bottom right of the screen.
//Drag and drop it to the storyboard. PS: Ignore that there are two tabs in this window, it goes away after the next step.
//Hold control and Drag the cursor from the main "Tab Bar Controller" to the new View Controller you dropped.
//Select the default automatic Relational Segue
//PS:You can ignore the weird looking relationship lines, they change if you position the View Controller differently.
//Change the Name of the tab by selecting The new view controller, and then selecting The tab of the view controller to open the attributes on the right top of the screen.
//Go to the "Attributes Inspector", under "Bar Item" add the name in the "Title" input box.


====================
Connect a label to code
++++++++++++++++++++++++
//Go to the Main.Storyboard and add a "Label" through the "View the Object Library" list on the bottom right of the screen.
//Drag and drop it to the storyboard.
//The window has a label to which we are going to attempt a connection
//In ViewController.h input this
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface ViewController : UIViewController
{
IBOutlet UILabel *label;
int integer;
}
@end

//In ViewController.m input this, basically just add the last two lines integer=0....integer]];

#import "ViewController.h"

@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    integer=0;
    [label setText:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d",integer]];
}
//There should be a bubble popped up left of "IBOutlet UILabel *label;" 
//PS To enable split view go to the end of the page
//Open a split window of FirstViewController.h and the Main.Storyboard, DONT hold control, drag your cursor from the bubble on the left of 
//"IBOutlet UILabel *label;"  to the label on the First View of you main Story board.

========================
Functions & Buttons
++++++++++++++++++
//We are going to press a button to perform a function
//The function will change the Label from 0 to 100.
//Steps taken from https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-IB_connections/chapters/CreatingAction.html
//Open a split window of FirstViewController.m and the Main.Storyboard, hold control, drag your cursor from the Button on the storyboard 
//to a spot on the ViewController.m file until its says "Insert Action Here" (within the implementation of ViewController)
//Name it as testButton
//You can type this with the curly brackets of the function just created and it will change 0 to 100 in the same text box
//when you click the button.
 - (IBAction)testButton:(id)sender {
  integer=100; //shows 100
    [label setText:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d",integer]];
}
//And you are done. I created another label called labelDown using the steps above in "Connect a label to code" 
//and tried to see if I can initialize another variable, and it worked.
- (IBAction)testButton:(id)sender {
    //integer  //Shows 0
    //integer=100; //shows 100
    //[labelDown setText:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d",integer]];
int integer2=50; Shows 50
[labelDown setText:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d",integer2]];
    
    }

TwoCalculators -Input, FormatConversion, RadioButton, Required, IfElse

//Follow "#General First steps shown below"
//Go to main story board and add two labels, and as shown using the steps above in "Connect a label to code", name them
//as labelDown and labelUp in the ViewController.h
